This is the final project for my web design class. I created a movie website where the user can search for a movie and use the filter tool to sort out the movies. When clicking on a movie, the movie will take you to different websites that have those movies and allow you to watch for free. There are only a few movies, and these are to present the ability to create websites. Note: The project did not start from scratch.
